/**
 * Site-wide incident history — every steward-logged incident (rulebook
 * 18.3, section 5 "Stewarding") ever recorded, across every round on file,
 * flattened for the History → Incidents page's three views (All Incidents,
 * by Driver, by Offense). There is no separate "incidents" table — every
 * row here is a `penalties` row (see src/lib/supabase.ts's own doc comment
 * on that table); this file just joins it with the round/driver/offense
 * context needed to display it outside the one-round-at-a-time Incident
 * Report page (src/pages/results/[subsessionId]/incidents.astro).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT built on computeDriverCareerStats() (src/lib/results.ts)
 * — that function runs the full standings/points engine for every driver's
 * whole career, which this page doesn't need at all. This is just raw
 * incident facts (who, what, how many, how much), so the fetch here is
 * much lighter: one getAllRounds(), one bulk getPenaltiesForSubsessions()
 * across every round on file, one driversSelect(), one getPenaltyOffenses()
 * — four queries total, no per-round or per-driver looping against the
 * database.
